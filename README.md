# Maximum Sum Sub-Array Dynamic Programming

It is a problem in which we have to find a sub-array whose sum is maximum. The problem could be solved using:

- Naive Approach
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming

In this repository, the dynamic programming solution has been implemented in the main.cpp file.

# Approach

The algorithm to solve the problem has been implemented using:

- bottom-up (Dynamic Programming)
